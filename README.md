# PracMachLearn_Project

## Weight Exercise Classification

In this project we will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6
participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways
(see (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) under Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset):

- Class A: exactly according to the specification
- Class B: throwing the elbows to the front 
- Class C: lifting the dumbbell only halfway
- Class D: lowering the dumbbell only halfway
- Class E: throwing the hips to the front

This project is aimed to train a learning machine to correctly predict and classify these tasks
when given the activation pattern of the accelerometers.
